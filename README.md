# **InfinityOS**

Welcome to **InfinityOS**, an experimental operating system written in Rust. This project explores the boundaries of Rust in systems programming and serves as a platform for learning and innovation.

## **Features**
- **Rust-Powered**: Fully written in Rust, focusing on safety, performance, and modern systems programming practices.
- **Bare Metal Development**: Runs directly on hardware, without relying on an existing operating system.
- **Learning-Oriented**: Aimed at understanding OS architecture, low-level programming, and Rust's capabilities in systems development.
- **Modular Design**: Designed for extensibility and future feature development.
